# Bamazon! The Node CLI app

### Overview

This project uses the npm "inquirer" package to prompt customers if they would like to shop. If yes, they are shown items listed in the store (pulled from MYSQL database and listed nice an tidy with ASCII Table). They can purchase by entering an item ID, if there is enough stock, they can purcahse and close out of the store.

### About the project

This is the MYSQL "Bamazon" assignment; part of my pursuit for the Northwestern FullStack Bootcamp Certification.

The project uses the following technology:
1. Node.js
2. MYSQL
3. Inquirer
4. ASCII table (to list the store items in an easy to read format).

To install, add the bamazonselect.sql file, then in a separate query run the bamazonselect.sql file, and import the items from the bamazonProducts.csv to populate the database.

To run this CLI app, npm install the requried packages. After installation enter "node bamazonCustomer.js"
